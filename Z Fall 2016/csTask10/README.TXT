MULTIPLE CHOICE:

2.2: a. int declares an integer
2.3: d. "number620" the plus concatenates instead of adds
2.4: b. 'b' has single quotation marks
2.5: a. 2 is the remainder after 30 is divided by 4
2.6: e. once 4.0 is conerted to an integer, it is 1/4

TRUE OR FALSE:

2.2: FALSE - a string literal appears inside double quotation marks
2.3: TRUE - escape sequences are used for double quotations, backlashes, skipped lines, tabs, and more
2.4: When + and - are binary operators, this is TRUE. When they are unary plus and unary minus, this is 
    FALSE.
2.5: TRUE - the computer converts in automatically
2.6: FALSE - the computer won't perform narrowing conversions automatically

SHORT ANSWER:

2.1: The method println from the object out in class System is running with the parameters of the string
    "I gotta be me!"   
2.2: 
Here we go! 12345
Test this if you are not sure. Another. 
All done.

2.3: It runs over two lines. Rewrite as:
System.out.println("To be or not to be, that" +
                    "is the question.");
2.4: 50 plus 25 is 5025

2.6:
a. The result that gets stored is 5 because 25/5 is 5.
b. The result that gets stored is 5.0, because 25/5 is 5, and is turned into a double.
c. The result that gets stored is 3, because 17/5 equals 3.4 but gets rounded down to an integer
d. The result that gets stored is 3.0, because 17/5 equals 3.4 but gets rounded and then turned into a 
    double
e. The result that gets stored is 3.4, because 17.0/5 is 3.4 and is a double.
f. The result that gets stored is 1.33020344 because thats the quotient of 17.0/12.78, not rounded.
g. The result that gets stored is 0, because 25/40 is 0.625, which is rounded down to 0.
h. The result that gets stored is 0.625, because 25/40 is 0.625, and num2 is automatically turned to a 
    double, so the quotient is a double. 
i. The result that gets stored is 0.625 because 25/40 is 0.625, and num1 is automatically turned to a 
    double, so the quotient is a double. 
j. The result that gets stored is 0.0.
k. The result that gets stored is 3.
l. The result that gets stored is 3.0.
m. The result that gets stored is 0.
n. The result that gets stored is 2.
o. The result that gets stored is 6.
p. The result that gets stored is 0.
q. The result thot gets stored is 0.
2.7: 
a. 1, 2, 3
b. 1, 2, 3
c. 3, 1, 2
d. 3, 1, 2
e. 1, 2, 3
f. 1, 2, 3
g. 1, 2, 3
h. 2, 1, 3
i. 2, 1, 3
j. 3, 1, 2
k. 2, 1, 3, 4
l. 3, 1, 2, 4
m. 1, 2, 4, 3
n. 1, 3, 2, 4
2.8:

time = days.Sunday
2.9:
Quest for the Holy Grail quest for the zoly grail

AP MULTIPLE CHOICE:
