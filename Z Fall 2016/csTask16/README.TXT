PROJECT TITLE: csTask16
VERSION or DATE: 10/24/16
AUTHORS: Odelia Lorch

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
3.1. e. I, II, and III 
3.2. d. no

TRUE OR FALSE:
3.1. True
3.2. False
3.3. False

SHORT ANSWER:
3.1. If two or more of the values are equal, the minimum will always be num3. It does not matter if two 
    equal values are higher or lower than the third.
3.2. The statement is missing an else statement, in the event that total == MAX but is not < sum:
if (total == MAX)
    if (total < sum)
        System.out.println("total == MAX and is < sum.");
    else
        System.out.println("total == MAX but is not < sum.");
else
    System.out.println("total is not equal to MAX.");
3.3. It uses '=' instead of '==', which assigns the variable instead of setting it equal and outputting a
    boolean result. Therefore, it won't compile.
3.4. 
apple
orange
pear
3.5.
lime 
grape
