PROJECT TITLE: csTask32
VERSION or DATE: 12/14/16
AUTHORS: Odelia Lorch

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
5.2. c. null

TRUE OR FALSE:
5.6. True
5.7. False - only if they are static variables
5.8. True

SHORT ANSWER:
5.3. Instance variables tell the state of an object, which is an instance of a class. Static methods are
    accessed through a class and not through an instance of a class, so they can't use variables that 
    depend on an instance.

AP MULTIPLE CHOICE:
5.1. d. Line 4

PROGRAMMING PROJECT:
5.1. (see PigLatin and PigLatinTranslator)
