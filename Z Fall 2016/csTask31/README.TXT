5.2. Java passes objects as parameters by taking in an actual parameter and transferring its value to a 
    formal parameter in the method definition. When passing objects as parameters, java passes a reference 
    to the object entered as a parameter, so the method takes a recreation of that object that is an 
    alias of that object. When passing primitive data, however, java can transfer its value directly, and
    doesn't have to reference it.
