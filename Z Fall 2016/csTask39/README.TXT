PROJECT TITLE: csTask39
VERSION or DATE: 13 January 2016
AUTHORS: Odelia Lorch

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
6.1. e. none of the above
6.2. d. I and III
6.3. b. for (int j=0; j < a.length; j++)

TRUE OR FALSE:
6.1. true
6.2. false
6.3. false
6.4. true
6.5. true

SHORT ANSWER:
6.1. Only the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 7th are valid. They include the word new followed by an array instance, 
or just an initializer list. 
6.3. The for loop in the code iterates through indexes assuming they go from the range of 1 to the length 
of the array. Instead, they go from 0 to one less than the length. The for loop header can be changed to 
look like:
for (int count = 0; count < numbers.length; count++)
