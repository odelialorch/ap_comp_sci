1. In this case, it might be helpful to name the class and task.
2. It is easier to read with this white space
3. "illegal start of expression"
4. No, it causes no problems

III. PROGRAM NAMES

1. simple - a legal identifier, but not a good choice to name this program, 
    because it starts with a lower case letter
2. SimpleProgram - a legal identifier, and a good choice to name
3. 1Simple - an illegal identifier because it starts with a digit
4. _Simple_ - a legal identifier, but a bad choice because it doesn't start with a
    capital letter
5. *Simple* - an illegal identifier, because it uses the asterisk character
6. $123_45 - a legal identifier, but a bad choice because it isn't descriptive and
    doesn't start with a capital letter
7. Simple! - an illegal identifier because it uses the exclamation mark

IV. RECOGNIZING SYNTAX ERRORS

2. "Class compiled - no syntax errors"
3. there are no errors because the message inside the string doesn't affect the
    functioning of the program. When run, though, the program now prints "Helo,
    World!"
4. "unclosed string literal"
5. "')' expected" no, i expected it to say unclosed string literal as well.
6. "';' expected"

V. CORRECTING SYNTAX ERRORS

- "')' expected" - added a first quotation mark
- "not a statement" - replaced 0ut with out
- "';' expected" - added a semicolon at the end of the line
- "unclosed string literal" - added an end quotation mark
- "cannot find symbol - class string" - replaced string with String
- "cannot find symbol - class Static" - replaced Static with static
- "invalid method declaration; return type required" - added void
