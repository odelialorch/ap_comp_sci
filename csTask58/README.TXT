MULTIPLE CHOICE:
8.7. e. curIndex+1
8.8. d. arrayTraverse(0, nums)
8.9. e. II and III <- what?
8.10. a. iterative solution

TRUE OR FALSE:
8.8. false
8.9. true
8.10. false

SHORT ANSWER:
8.11. The pivot has to be the median value of the list or sublist - in order to find this, need to add a search to the 
process, which reduces the time efficiency of the quick sort.

AP MULTIPLE CHOICE:
8.5. c. I and II only
8.6. d. process(0, a) + process(1, a)
