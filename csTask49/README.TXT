PROJECT TITLE: csTask49
VERSION or DATE: 1 March 2017
AUTHORS: Odelia Lorch

I3b. I eliminated the instantiation, rather than creating a new class RealDog. Inheritance makes sense to me as sort of 
    category/subcategory relationship. Dog seems to be a more general category than Yorkshire and Labrador, so making a 
    general dog with RealDog doesn't make a category at the same level as Yorkshire and Labrador.
